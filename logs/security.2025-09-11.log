2025-09-11 23:45:29 SECURITY [restartedMain] WARN  - Global AuthenticationManager configured with an AuthenticationProvider bean. UserDetailsService beans will not be used by Spring Security for automatically configuring username/password login. Consider removing the AuthenticationProvider bean. Alternatively, consider using the UserDetailsService in a manually instantiated DaoAuthenticationProvider. If the current configuration is intentional, to turn off this warning, increase the logging level of 'org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.configuration.InitializeUserDetailsBeanManagerConfigurer' to ERROR

This is discouraged; please include the leading slash in all your request matcher patterns. In future versions of Spring Security, leaving out the leading slash will result in an exception.
